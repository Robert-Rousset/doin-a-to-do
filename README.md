# The Todo

A simple to do list app that lets users write down their tasks and mark them as complete!

## Usage

To use this app, simply visit https://robert-rousset.github.io/doin-a-to-do/ and log in with a username of 4 or more characters. After logging in you'll be directed to the dashboard where you can write any todo's in the input area and press the + to add it to your todo list!
In your list you can click on the tick to cross them off, and then click the x to delete the todo.
In the top left you may click settings where you can change your name and change to a different theme.
